# Group 6 - System development



## Purpose and benefits

Envirobaby is a desktop application, designed to provide nurseries with reliable real-time monitoring about key environmental factors. 
The system continuously tracks temperature, humidity and noise levels to ensure optimal conditions for babies and young children, keeping them healthy and comfortable.
It also provides caregivers with real-time alerts when any of the environmental parameters breach their predefined thresholds, and allows customisation in order to make the system suitable for specific childcare needs.

By automating the monitoring process, Envirobaby offers nurseries improved resource management. 
Caregivers can now spend less time time manually checking and monitoring room conditions, and focus more on direct childcare. 
Furthermore, this also improves childrenâ€™s safety and comfort by reducing the risk of human error. The system is designed to be scalable for up to 4 nursery rooms, making it suitable for larger-scale nurseries as well.
